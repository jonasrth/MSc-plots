### Python code for MSc thesis figures

---

Python scripts visualise data from large 3D solar atmosphere simulations (simulated by CO5BOLD), and data from radiative transfer calculations performed on these simulations (using [ART](https://github.com/SolarAlma/ART), Linfor3D, [RH 1.5D](https://github.com/ITA-Solar/rh)). The data was provided in HDF5 files, and is not publically available. The figures produced by the python scripts can be found in the "figures" folder.
