### Python code for MSc thesis figures

---

Python scripts visualise data from large 3D solar atmosphere simulations (simulated by CO5BOLD), and data from radiative transfer calculations performed on these simulations (using [ART](https://github.com/SolarAlma/ART), Linfor3D, [RH 1.5D](https://github.com/ITA-Solar/rh)). The data was provided in HDF5 files, and is not publically available. The figures produced by the python scripts can be found in the "figures" folder.

**Contents:**

- **figures** : Contains figures produced by pythons scripts in PDF format. The .pdf files have the same name as the scripts producing them (usually).
- **files** : Some pickle files with data compiled from the .hdf5 files that would take too long to calculate each time.
